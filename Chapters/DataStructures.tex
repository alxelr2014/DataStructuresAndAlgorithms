\section{Elementary structures}
\subsection{Stack}
Stack is FIFO, \textit{First in first out}. We can do \(m\) pushes (with doubling if needed) and \(n\) pops in the order of \(\bigO{m + n}\).
\begin{example}
    Some examples of stacks include
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Bracket matching
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\subsection{Queue}
Queue is LIFO, \textit{Last in first out}.
Pushing (amortized) and poping is done in constant time, \(\bigO{1}\).
\begin{example}
    Some examples of stacks include
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item simulating queues -\_-
    \end{enumerate}
\end{example}

\subsection{Linked lists}
In \textbf{singly linked list} every element points to the next element. In \textbf{doubly linked list} every element points to the next and previous element. In \textbf{circulare linked list} the last element's next is the head and the head's previous is the last. Insertion and deletion is done in constant time.
